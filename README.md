# Public Domain Worship Website

This website is designed to host public domain praise and worship songs. The idea
is to allow anyone worldwide to have free access to quality praise and worship music.

Subscription services exist to allow churches to perform copyrighted music a certain number
of times per month, but by their nature they come with a price tag. Not all churches can
afford such a subscription. This site aims to host sheet music and sample audio files for
free, public domain, Christian praise and worship music.
